# VTube Services

The service component of the v-tube application. 

## Development

To run an individual instance of v-tube locally pull [VTube] and follow the instructions. Video Metadata is extracted via [Sannies-Mp4].

## Testing

Unit tests are simple enough, your basic JUnit with a SpringBootRunner abstracted behind a class called `VTubeTest`. To run tests, just run `mvn test`
